Alright everyone, let's talk about Snapshots in Apache Iceberg.
Snapshots represent the state of a table at a given point in time. Think of a snapshot as a version of your table — it shows exactly what data existed in the table at that specific moment.
Now, if you want to access all the data files at a particular snapshot, Iceberg uses manifest files. These manifest files act like an index or catalog, listing every data file that belongs to that snapshot.
If you look at the diagram:
At the top, we have the Iceberg Catalog, which keeps track of the latest table metadata.
Each snapshot points to a metadata file.
The metadata file contains references to manifest lists.
Each manifest list contains multiple manifest files, and inside those manifest files, there’s a row pointing to individual data files.
A key takeaway here is that Iceberg never overwrites data. Instead, every change creates a new snapshot while preserving the older versions — enabling time travel and rollback capabilities.
This structure helps Iceberg maintain high performance with large datasets while making queries consistent and reliable.

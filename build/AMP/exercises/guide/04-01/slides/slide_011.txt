"In Step 4, we’ll move from raw data to a more structured environment by building a data lakehouse. A data lakehouse combines the scalability of a data lake with the performance and reliability of a data warehouse.
Here’s what we’ll do:
Create a curated layer from the raw CSV tables we worked with in Step 3. This curated layer will be stored in a database called <user_id>_airlines.
Use Hive and Iceberg table formats:
Hive is a traditional table format that’s widely used and compatible with many tools.
Iceberg is a modern table format that supports advanced features like schema evolution and time travel.
Migrate from Hive to Iceberg:
We’ll use table migration features to move data from Hive to Iceberg.
We’ll also use Create Table as Select (CTAS) to create new Iceberg tables from existing Hive tables.
Why is this important?
A data lakehouse gives you the flexibility to work with both raw and curated data. Iceberg’s advanced features make it easier to manage large datasets and perform complex operations like schema changes without disrupting workflows."

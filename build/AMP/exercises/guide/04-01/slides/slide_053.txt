we're going to explore how Apache Iceberg integrates with the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP). This integration brings several powerful features that enhance data management, query performance, and overall efficiency. Let's go through the key points:

1. **Reuse Existing Hive Catalog**:
   - You can easily manage Iceberg tables using your existing Hive Catalog.
   - This allows for seamless integration and reduces the complexity of managing multiple catalogs.

2. **Query Iceberg Tables**:
   - Iceberg tables can be queried seamlessly using Hive Beeline or Impala CLI.
   - This ensures that your existing queries remain intact, with no changes required, facilitating a smooth transition.

3. **Smooth Migration**:
   - Migrating from Hive/Impala to Iceberg is straightforward.
   - You can also convert Delta Lake tables to a Lakehouse automatically, simplifying the migration process.

4. **Access Control**:
   - Control access to your data with ease using Ranger Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
   - This ensures that your data remains secure and accessible only to authorized users.

5. **Zero-Copy Cloning**:
   - Utilize zero-copy cloning for faster data replication.
   - This feature allows you to create copies of your data without duplicating the actual data, saving storage and improving efficiency.

6. **Cloud Migration**:
   - Lift and shift to any public cloud CDP effortlessly.
   - Migrate easily from HDFS to Ozone with S3 API compatibility, ensuring flexibility and scalability in your cloud environment.

7. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Reduce the total cost of ownership by adding more workloads without worrying about increasing cluster size.
   - This makes Iceberg on CDP a cost-effective solution for managing large-scale data.

In summary, Iceberg on CDP offers a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing and querying large datasets. Its seamless integration with existing tools and smooth migration capabilities make it an excellent choice for organizations looking to enhance their data infrastructure.

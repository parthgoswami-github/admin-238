"Let’s discuss how **snapshots** in Apache Iceberg can be used to track **change history**. This is particularly useful when your application has been making numerous modifications to an Iceberg table, and you need to review all the operations (inserts, updates, deletes) from a specific snapshot.

Imagine you have a table that has undergone many changes, and you want to scan all the operations starting from a particular snapshot. Iceberg makes this easy with its **change tracking** capabilities. You can use the `start-snapshot-id` option to specify the snapshot from which you want to start scanning changes. Here’s an example:

```scala
spark.read
  .option("start-snapshot-id", "5428767791685681193")
  .table("local.db.table1.changes")
  .show()
```

This query will return all the changes (inserts, updates, deletes) that have occurred since the specified snapshot. This is incredibly useful for **Type 2 table changes**, where you need to track historical changes for auditing, compliance, or analytical purposes.

To summarize:
- **Change History**: Iceberg allows you to track all modifications (inserts, updates, deletes) from a specific snapshot.
- **Practical Use**: This feature is particularly useful for Type 2 table changes, where maintaining a history of changes is crucial.

This capability ensures that you can always review and analyze the evolution of your data, providing transparency and accountability.

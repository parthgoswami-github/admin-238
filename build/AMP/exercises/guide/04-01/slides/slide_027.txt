"Let’s explore how **read and write operations** work in Apache Iceberg. Understanding these operations is key to leveraging Iceberg’s capabilities effectively.
First, let’s talk about the **Reader**. In Iceberg, a reader always reads data from the **most recent snapshot**. This ensures that queries always return the latest state of the data. Because Iceberg maintains a clear and consistent view of the table through snapshots, readers can efficiently access the data they need without worrying about inconsistencies.
Now, let’s look at the **Writer**. When a writer performs an operation—such as an insert, update, or delete—it creates a **new snapshot**. This new snapshot captures the changes made by the write operation. However, it’s important to note that **uncommitted snapshots are not visible to queries**. This means that until the write operation is committed, the changes are not accessible to readers. This isolation ensures data consistency and prevents partial or incomplete data from being queried.
To summarize:
- **Reader**: Reads data from the most recent snapshot, ensuring access to the latest state of the table.
- **Writer**: Creates a new snapshot with each write operation, but uncommitted snapshots are not visible to queries.
This separation of read and write operations, combined with the use of snapshots, allows Iceberg to provide strong consistency and reliability. It ensures that readers always see a complete and consistent view of the data, while writers can make changes without disrupting ongoing queries.

"Let’s explore how to create an external Iceberg table with files stored in Ozone. This is a common scenario when working with distributed storage systems and Iceberg for big data processing."

---

**Key Points to Highlight:**

1. **Creating an External Table:**
   - "To create an external Iceberg table, use the `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` statement. This ensures that the table metadata is managed by Iceberg, but the actual data is stored externally, in this case, in Ozone."
   - "In the example provided, we’re creating a table named `table_ext` with columns for `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_amount`, `order_ts`, and `order_hr`."

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE table_ext (
     order_id BIGINT,
     customer_id BIGINT,
     order_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
     order_ts TIMESTAMP,
     order_hr int
   )
   USING iceberg
   PARTITIONED BY (order_hr)
   LOCATION 'ofs://ozone1/tenant1/warehouse/iceberg/default/table_ext'
   ```

2. **Partitioning:**
   - "The table is partitioned by the `order_hr` column. Partitioning helps improve query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned."
   - "Partition pruning, which is the process of skipping irrelevant partitions during query execution, depends on specifying the partition ID in the `WHERE` clause. For example, if you query data for a specific hour, Iceberg will only scan the relevant partition."

3. **Storage Format:**
   - "The `USING iceberg` clause specifies that the table is managed by Iceberg, which provides advanced features like schema evolution, time travel, and efficient metadata management."

4. **Location:**
   - "The `LOCATION` clause specifies the path in Ozone where the data files are stored. This path should point to the directory containing the data files for the table. In this example, the location is `ofs://ozone1/tenant1/warehouse/iceberg/default/table_ext`."

---

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- "A common mistake is not specifying the correct location for the external table, which can lead to errors or missing data."
- "Another mistake is forgetting to include the partition column in the `WHERE` clause, which can result in full table scans and slower query performance."

---

**Best Practices:**
- "Always specify the correct location for external tables to ensure Iceberg can access the data."
- "Use partitioning to improve query performance and ensure partition pruning by including partition columns in the `WHERE` clause."
- "Leverage Iceberg’s advanced features like schema evolution and time travel to manage your data more effectively."

**Closing:**
"Creating external tables in Iceberg with data stored in Ozone is a powerful way to manage large datasets. By following these best practices, you can ensure efficient data access and query performance.

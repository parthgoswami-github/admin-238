"Let’s walk through a practical example of **schema evolution** in Apache Iceberg. This example will demonstrate how you can modify the schema of a table to accommodate new requirements or improve clarity.

Here’s a sequence of schema changes applied to a table named `tablet`:

1. **Rename a Column**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tablet RENAME COLUMN order_amount TO amt;
   ```
   This command renames the `order_amount` column to `amt`. Renaming columns can help improve the clarity and consistency of your schema.

2. **Add a New Column**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tablet ADD COLUMN fare_per_distance_unit float AFTER amt;
   ```
   This command adds a new column named `fare_per_distance_unit` of type `float` after the `amt` column. Adding new columns is common when you need to include additional data fields.

3. **Rename the New Column**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tablet RENAME COLUMN fare_per_distance_unit TO fare_per_distance;
   ```
   This command renames the newly added column to `fare_per_distance`. This step ensures that the column name is more descriptive and aligned with your naming conventions.

4. **Add a Comment to a Column**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tablet ALTER COLUMN amt COMMENT 'amt for a trip based on trip distance in miles. Added by on 2201-01-15';
   ```
   This command adds a comment to the `amt` column, providing context about its purpose and the date it was added. Comments are useful for documentation and understanding the schema.

5. **Change the Data Type of a Column**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tablet ALTER COLUMN amt TYPE decimal(15,2);
   ```
   This command changes the data type of the `amt` column to `decimal(15,2)`. Changing data types can be necessary to accommodate more precise or different types of data.

These commands illustrate how you can evolve your schema to meet new requirements without needing to rewrite the underlying data files. Iceberg’s ability to handle these changes as metadata operations makes schema evolution efficient and non-disruptive.

To summarize:
- **Rename Columns**: Improve clarity and consistency.
- **Add Columns**: Incorporate new data fields.
- **Add Comments**: Provide context and documentation.
- **Change Data Types**: Adapt to new data requirements.

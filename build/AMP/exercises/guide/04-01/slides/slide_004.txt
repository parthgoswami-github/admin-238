Access raw data stored in cloud storage like AWS S3.
Build a data lakehouse using Hive and Iceberg table formats.
Optimize performance and maintain tables using Impala.
Create dashboards and visualizations using Cloudera Data Visualization.
The tools we’ll use include AWS S3, Hive, Iceberg, Impala, and Cloudera Data Visualization. By the end of this session, you’ll have hands-on experience with these tools and understand how they fit into a modern data workflow."

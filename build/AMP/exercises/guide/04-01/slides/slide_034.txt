"Letâ€™s discuss **schema evolution** in Apache Iceberg. Schema evolution refers to the process of changing the structure and design of your database over time to accommodate new features, requirements, or performance improvements. Iceberg makes schema evolution seamless and efficient.

One of the key advantages of Iceberg is that **schema updates are metadata changes**. This means that you can modify the schema without needing to rewrite any data files. This is a significant performance benefit, especially for large datasets.

Iceberg supports several types of schema evolution changes:
- **Add**: You can add a new column to the table or to a nested struct. This is useful when you need to include new data fields.
- **Drop**: You can remove an existing column from the table or a nested struct. This helps in cleaning up unused or obsolete data fields.
- **Rename**: You can rename an existing column or field in a nested struct. This is helpful for maintaining clarity and consistency in your schema.
- **Update**: You can widen the type of a column, struct field, map key, map value, or list element. This allows for more flexibility in data types as your requirements evolve.
- **Reorder**: You can change the order of columns or fields in a nested struct. This can be useful for organizational purposes or to meet specific application requirements.

These schema evolution capabilities ensure that your database can adapt to changing needs without requiring extensive data migration or downtime. This makes Iceberg a robust choice for dynamic and evolving data environments.

To summarize:
- **Schema Evolution**: The process of changing the database structure over time.
- **Metadata Changes**: Iceberg schema updates are metadata-only, so no data files need to be rewritten.
- **Supported Changes**: Add, Drop, Rename, Update, and Reorder columns or fields.

Let’s discuss the concept of **snapshots** in Apache Iceberg. Snapshots are a fundamental feature that help manage the state of your data over time, providing both flexibility and reliability.

A **snapshot** in Iceberg is essentially a complete list of all the files that make up a table at the time of a specific commit. Every time you perform a write operation—whether it’s an insert, update, or delete—Iceberg creates a new snapshot. This new snapshot captures the state of the table after that commit.

For example:
- **Snapshot 0** might represent the initial state of your table after the first set of data is written.
- **Snapshot 1** would then represent the state of the table after the next commit, and so on.

Each snapshot includes references to the data files that are part of that particular state of the table. This allows Iceberg to provide features like **time travel**, where you can query the table as it existed at a specific point in time by referencing the appropriate snapshot.

The ability to create and manage snapshots is one of the reasons Iceberg is so powerful. It ensures that you can always access previous states of your data, which is invaluable for debugging, auditing, and recovering from errors.

To summarize:
- **Snapshots** represent the state of a table at a particular point in time.
- Each write commit produces a new snapshot.
- Snapshots enable features like time travel and rollback, making data management more flexible and reliable.

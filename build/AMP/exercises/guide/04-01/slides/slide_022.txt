let’s take a look at this slide, which focuses on the **SQL performance** when using the **Iceberg table format**. This is a really important topic, especially when we’re dealing with large-scale data processing.

One of the key takeaways here is that Iceberg provides **consistent Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** when running queries. What does that mean? Well, it means that you don’t see performance degradation even when you’re querying massive datasets—whether it’s 1 billion or 10 billion records. That’s a huge advantage, especially in environments where performance consistency is critical.

Now, let’s break down the data we have here. Over **100 complex SQL statements** were analyzed, and the results are quite impressive. One of the notable outcomes is a **reduction in load on YARN by almost 40%**. YARN, as you know, is a resource management layer in Hadoop, so reducing its load can lead to more efficient resource utilization across your cluster.

Let’s look at the table for some specific examples:

- **1.7 billion rows**: The query time is just **2 seconds**. That’s incredibly fast for such a large dataset.
- **5.2 billion rows**: The query time increases only slightly to **2.2 seconds**. Again, this shows how Iceberg maintains performance even as data scales.
- **10 billion rows**: Here, we see a bit more variability. Initially, the query time jumps to **9 seconds**, but this is due to factors like **updates, deletes, and data skew**, which can impact performance. However, after performing **table maintenance**, the query time drops back down to **2.5 seconds**. This highlights the importance of regular maintenance to keep performance optimal.

So, what does this tell us? Iceberg is designed to handle large-scale data efficiently, but it’s also important to manage your tables properly to maintain that performance. Regular maintenance can help mitigate issues like data skew and ensure that your queries run as quickly as possible.

"Let’s explore how **snapshots** in Apache Iceberg enable powerful features like **time travel**. This functionality allows you to query data as it existed at a specific point in time, which is incredibly useful for debugging, auditing, and historical analysis.

First, let’s look at how you can **get the snapshot history** of a table. You can use a SQL query to retrieve the history of snapshots for a table. For example:

```sql
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM local.db.table1.history").show()
```

This query will return a list of all snapshots associated with the table, including details like the snapshot ID, timestamp, and the changes made. This history is essential for understanding how your data has evolved over time.

Next, let’s discuss how to **query data based on a particular snapshot ID**. You can specify a snapshot ID to read data as it existed at that specific point in time. Here’s an example:

```scala
spark.read
  .option("start-snapshot-id", "snapshotid")
  .table("local.db.table1.changes")
  .show()
```

This allows you to perform **time travel** by querying the state of the table at a specific snapshot. This is particularly useful for recovering from errors or analyzing historical data.

Finally, let’s talk about **incremental reads**. Iceberg allows you to read changes between two snapshots, which is useful for tracking changes over time. Here’s how you can do it:

```scala
spark.read
  .option("start-snapshot-id", 6614408580212802828L)
  .option("end-snapshot-id", 2649581806680384956L)
  .load("local.db.table1")
  .show()
```

This query will return all the changes that occurred between the specified start and end snapshots. This is particularly useful for **change data capture (CDC)** and **incremental processing**.

To summarize:
- **Snapshot History**: Retrieve the history of snapshots to understand how your data has changed over time.
- **Time Travel**: Query data as it existed at a specific snapshot ID.
- **Incremental Reads**: Read changes between two snapshots for incremental processing and change tracking.

These features make Iceberg a powerful tool for managing and analyzing large datasets with complex histories.

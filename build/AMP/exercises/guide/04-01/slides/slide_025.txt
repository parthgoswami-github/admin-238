Let’s take a closer look at how **Hive** and **Iceberg** manage files. This comparison is crucial for understanding the differences in their architectures and how they impact performance and scalability.

First, let’s examine the **Hive** file structure. In Hive, data is typically organized into directories based on partitions. For example, you might see directories like `dt=2016-01-01`, `dt=2016-01-02`, and so on. Each directory contains data files, such as `part-00000-3b3589f2-bcbb-47a0-9e4d-3483717e4203.c000.snappy.org`. This directory-based approach can lead to performance issues as the number of directories and files grows, because Hive has to scan through these directories to find the relevant data.

Now, let’s look at **Iceberg**. At first glance, the file structure might look similar, with directories like `dt=2016-01-01` and corresponding data files. However, the key difference lies in how Iceberg manages metadata. Iceberg introduces a **metadata layer** that includes files like `v1.metadata.json`, `v2.metadata.json`, and `version-hint.text`. These metadata files keep track of the table’s state, snapshots, and the location of data files.

The metadata layer in Iceberg allows it to bypass the directory scanning issue that Hive faces. Instead of pointing to directories, Iceberg maintains a **canonical list of files** that make up the table. This approach leads to a **10x performance improvement** because Iceberg can quickly locate the necessary data files without scanning through multiple directories.

To summarize:
- **Hive**: Uses a directory-based approach, which can lead to performance degradation as the number of directories and files increases.
- **Iceberg**: Uses a metadata layer to maintain a list of files, enabling faster and more efficient data access.

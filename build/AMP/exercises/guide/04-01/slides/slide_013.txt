"In Step 6, we’ll shift our focus to data visualization. The goal here is to create a Logistics Dashboard that provides insights into flight delays and cancellations.
Here’s what we’ll do:
Data Modeling:
Prepare the data for visualization by defining relationships and metrics. This step ensures that the data is structured in a way that makes sense for analysis.
Create Visualizations:
Use Cloudera Data Visualization to build charts, graphs, and dashboards. We’ll focus on flight data, analyzing delays and cancellations to identify trends and insights.
Why is this important?
Visualization turns complex data into actionable insights. A well-designed dashboard makes it easy for stakeholders to understand the data and make informed decisions."

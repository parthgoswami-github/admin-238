Centralized Monitoring Solution
"Managing multiple models across different environments can be complex. That’s where a centralized monitoring solution becomes essential."
CML offers a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor all deployed models in one place.
It also supports alerting and external system integration, enabling proactive issue detection and resolution.
Tracking Technical Metrics
"Beyond just deploying models, we need to track key technical metrics to ensure operational reliability."
Uptime: Ensuring that models remain available and accessible to applications.
Status: Monitoring whether a model is running correctly or facing issues.
SLA Adherence: Tracking service-level agreements, ensuring models meet performance and response time requirements.
Tracking Mathematical Metrics
"In addition to technical health, we must also track how well the models are performing in real-world conditions."
Prediction Distribution: Monitoring the output distribution of models over time to detect anomalies.
Drift Detection: Identifying when data distributions shift, which could indicate that the model needs retraining.
Input Distribution: Tracking input data characteristics to ensure consistency and prevent unexpected changes.
Since different models have different requirements, these monitoring metrics can be customized accordingly.

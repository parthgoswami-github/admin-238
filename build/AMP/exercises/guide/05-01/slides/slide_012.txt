Introduction:
Machine Learning models can be trained faster by distributing workloads across multiple machines.
Several frameworks support distributed ML, each optimized for different use cases.
Key Frameworks:
Apache Spark: Popular for big data processing with MLlib for distributed ML.
Dask & Ray: Parallel computing frameworks for Python-based ML workflows.
Horovod: Optimizes deep learning training across multiple GPUs.
TensorFlow & PyTorch: Support distributed training for deep learning.
H2O & Rapids: GPU-accelerated ML for large-scale data.
Mahout & DL4J: Java-based ML frameworks for scalable AI applications.
sk-dist: Extends scikit-learn for distributed model training.
Why Distributed ML?
Handles large datasets efficiently.
Speeds up training with parallel processing.
Enables model scaling for real-world applications.
Key Takeaway:
Choose the right framework based on your ML needsâ€”big data, deep learning, or parallel computing. ðŸš€

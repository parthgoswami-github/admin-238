Industrialized machine learning requires more than tools for building and training models… here’s what industrialized ML for powering intelligent apps from the Edge2AI looks like:

Data streaming or batch ingested into the pipeline
Data engineering to clean and prep
Building and training models
Embedding intelligence in the fabric of business, whether through:
Predictive services/APIs
BI Dashboards
Data Products/Apps
Intelligent edge devices

Bottom line:  Industrial AI requires a platform for intelligence from the edge to AI and back.

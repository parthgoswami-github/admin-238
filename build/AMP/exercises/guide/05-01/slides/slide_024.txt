Automated Deployments
"CML provides automated deployments, allowing us to complete the last mile of ML deployment seamlessly."
"Once a model is trained and validated, it can be deployed into a production environment with minimal manual effort."
"This automation reduces errors, speeds up time-to-market, and ensures consistency across deployments."
Addressing Multiple Deployment Patterns
"In an enterprise setting, we donâ€™t just deploy models in one way. CML supports multiple deployment patterns, such as:"
Batch Processing: "Useful for large-scale offline inference, where models process large datasets at scheduled intervals."
Function as a Service (FaaS): "Allows models to be deployed as serverless functions that respond to API requests."
Streaming: "Models can be integrated with real-time data streams for continuous inference, which is essential for applications like fraud detection."
Edge Deployment: "For IoT and mobile applications, models can be deployed closer to the data source, reducing latency and improving performance."
Enterprise Capabilities
"Enterprise AI workloads require robust capabilities, and CML offers:"
High Availability: "Ensures that ML services remain operational even in case of failures."
Autoscaling: "Automatically scales model replicas based on demand, ensuring optimal resource usage."
Security by Default: "CML integrates with Cloudera SDX, ensuring governance, compliance, and role-based access controls."
Architecture Overview (Diagram Explanation)
"On the left, you see how models are deployed as multiple replicas to ensure availability and scalability."
"The Cloudera AI Runtime (CML) enables execution environments for Python, R, and Spark."
"Underneath, CDP provides the infrastructure, running on Kubernetes (EKS or AKS) and leveraging Cloudera SDX for security and governance."
"Finally, data is stored in Object Stores or HDFS (S3 or ABFS), ensuring scalable and reliable storage for models and datasets."

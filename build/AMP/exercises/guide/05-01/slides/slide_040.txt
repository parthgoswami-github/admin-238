Let’s take a closer look at the model lifecycle and how MLflow simplifies tracking and deployment using the Model Registry.
First, in Workspace 1, the user logs metrics and models during training sessions using MLflow APIs like mlflow.log_metric or mlflow.log_model. These commands allow you to record key performance metrics and save your model in a structured format.
Once the metrics and models are logged, users can view the results in the Experiments UI. This interface provides a detailed view of all experiment runs, making it easy to compare metrics, analyze performance, and identify the best-performing model.
When a preferred experiment run is identified, the user can select ‘Register Model’, which adds the model version to the Model Registry. The Model Registry acts as a centralized location to manage and version models, ensuring proper tracking and reproducibility across teams and environments.
From the Model Registry, users can continue iterating and refining the model or move toward deployment. For deployment, a user working in Workspace 2 can select a model version from the registry and deploy it via the Model REST API. This ensures seamless integration of the model into production systems.
Key takeaway: MLflow's Model Registry not only tracks your models throughout the lifecycle but also provides a smooth pathway from experimentation to production deployment, ensuring transparency and scalability."

Introduction:
Web applications can be built using various frameworks based on project needs and programming language preferences.
The choice of framework depends on scalability, ease of use, and community support.
Popular Frameworks:
Flask (Python): Lightweight and flexible, ideal for small applications and APIs.
Django (Python): A full-featured framework with built-in security, ORM, and authentication.
Node.js (JavaScript): Best for real-time applications with event-driven, non-blocking architecture.
Shiny (R): Specialized for interactive web apps in R, widely used for data visualization.
Key Considerations:
Choose Flask for quick development and simplicity.
Use Django for enterprise-grade applications.
Opt for Node.js for performance-intensive apps.
Use Shiny for interactive data-driven applications.
Key Takeaway:
Selecting the right framework ensures efficiency and scalability in app development.

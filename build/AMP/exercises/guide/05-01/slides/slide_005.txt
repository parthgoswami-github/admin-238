This slide presents a high-level view of the Machine Learning (ML) production workflow, illustrating how ML models transition from development to deployment and monitoring. It also highlights the different roles involved at each stage.
Key Talking Points:
Introduction to ML in Production
"Machine Learning models don’t just stop at training. To bring real business value, they need to be deployed into production environments where they can serve predictions reliably."
"This process requires collaboration between multiple teams, including data engineers, data scientists, DevOps, ML engineers, and business stakeholders."
Key Stages in the ML Pipeline
Business Inputs & Data Engineering:
"It all starts with business requirements and data."
"Business stakeholders define the problem, and data engineers prepare the necessary data pipelines."
Data Science & Model Training:
"Data scientists take this data to train models, experimenting with various algorithms to find the best fit."
"This is where feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning happen."
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps):
"Once a model is trained, it moves into the operations phase, often managed by DevOps and ML Engineers."
Packaging: "The model is containerized or saved in a model registry to be version-controlled and prepared for deployment."
Deployment & Serving: "The model is deployed using APIs, batch inference, or real-time serving mechanisms."
Monitoring: "Once live, continuous monitoring is essential to track model performance, data drift, and system health."
Feedback Loops & Business Validation
"The cycle doesn’t end at deployment—monitoring results feed back into model retraining."
"The business team validates if the model meets expectations and determines whether further improvements are needed."
Roles and Responsibilities
"Different roles contribute at various stages:"
Business & IT – Data Engineering: Prepares and processes the data.
Data Scientists: Develop and train the model.
IT – DevOps: Ensures smooth infrastructure setup and automation.
MLOps/ML Engineers: Deploy and maintain the model in production.
Business Stakeholders: Validate the outcomes and define improvements.
Closing Thought
"MLOps is key to ensuring that ML models remain useful and effective over time. Without proper packaging, deployment, and monitoring, even the best-trained model can fail in production."

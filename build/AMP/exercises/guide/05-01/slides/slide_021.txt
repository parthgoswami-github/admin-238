This diagram outlines the MLOps pipeline, which demonstrates the lifecycle of a Machine Learning (ML) project from data collection to operationalization. Here's a breakdown of the pipeline components:
1. Data
Data Collection: The process begins with gathering raw data from various sources such as databases, APIs, logs, etc.
Data Curation: This step involves cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming raw data into a usable format. This can include handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Data Preparation: The curated data is further processed and split into training, validation, and testing datasets to make it ready for ML tasks.
2. Model Development
Model Building: Using the prepared data, a machine learning algorithm is selected and implemented to create a model. This step involves feature selection and setting up the initial architecture of the model.
Model Training: The model is trained on the training dataset to learn patterns and make predictions.
Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated on the validation dataset to assess its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE (depending on the task).
Model Selection: Based on the evaluation results, the best-performing model is selected among multiple candidates (e.g., Model A, Model B, Model C).
3. Operationalization
Model Packaging: The selected model is prepared for deployment by packaging it into a format suitable for production environments (e.g., a containerized application).
Model Serving/Deployment: The model is deployed to a production environment where it can process live data and make predictions.
Monitoring: The deployed model is continuously monitored to ensure its performance remains acceptable over time. Monitoring involves tracking metrics, drift, and errors.
Retraining: If new data becomes available or model performance degrades, the model is retrained and updated in the production environment.
4. Feedback Loop
New data from the production environment is fed back into the pipeline for retraining, ensuring the model adapts to changes over time.
This pipeline represents the iterative and automated approach of MLOps to manage the lifecycle of machine learning models in production while ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency.

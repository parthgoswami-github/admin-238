**Version 1.0.0**


Welcome to Just Enough Kubernetes. Learning the architecture for orchestrating microservices. Follow along with your instructor to complete each section.

# About This Training

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates the management of containerized applications. It's also known as "K8s". Kubernetes has fundamentally transformed the software development and operations of the modern enterprise. It is the de facto standard for container orchestration. While it addresses a critical need for deploying and managing containers, it is by necessity a complex system.

This course provides an explanation of architecture and the basic skills required for understanding Kubernetes. The course is focused on explaining how it works by defining the architecture for clusters, the control plane, and resources. The course requires students to install a small-scale Kubernetes environment and run a basic deployment of containers.

# Who Should Take This Course?

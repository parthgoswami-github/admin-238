### 8. Click "desktop"
Scroll down the page to find Using Pods. Kubernetes presents many example command lines. Kubernetes also includes model code blocks in YAML format. There is a copy and paste icon in the upper right corner of the code block. It is common practice to copy in a code block into your IDE and to then edit it in your IDE.
